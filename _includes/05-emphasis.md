I have **failed** at more careers during the last few years than most folks have in their entire life.  :disappointed:
I have a degree in Computer & Information Science and 12 years of experience but _absolutely **no** job skills._  I spent 7 years at Amazon, mostly wanting to kill myself.  I have lived in Lexington for 15 years and have *absolutely* __zero support network and *zero friends.*__ :scream:  This is my chance to put my life back together, there is _no going back_, __no plan B__.  As of February 21st I will be out of a job and my next one will be as a programmer.  Still I keep plugging away and **_I always succeed._** .  :triumph:
